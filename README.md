#### **Title:** GitHub Actions Tooling Catalog

**Main goal:** ***Develop a Continuous Integration tool catalog.***

**Abstract:**  When a change is made to a software project, we want to make sure that the system still works after that change and does not cause any further problems. We rebuild the software and subject it to specific tests, approve it and report it as needed. The system that enables these processes to be automatically triggered by the events we have determined is *continuous integration*. Some different platforms and tools provide continuous integration. *GitHub Action* is one of them, and it allows automation processes such as build, test, and validation. In this work, we will develop a catalog that shows which GitHub action features we can use on which tools or platforms.

We're going to add a workflow to a simple project we've developed. We will identify which development tools or platforms support or offer which features and create our catalog.
